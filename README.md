# Erebus_Picture_Network
Convolutional neural netowrk, in pytorch, is used to classifiy images of Erebus's lava lake for eruptions

This was a project I finished for a University class on geologic data processing. The IR images come from the MEVO project 
on Mt. Erebus. Eruption times were found by another student before me, Brian Dye. The code was written entirely by myself.

If you use this code for anything, I simply ask that you inform me of said use for my curosity and include my name.

Thanks.
